### First Release
When I watched all First Multiplayer Game playlist videos from Filipe Deschamps's youtube channel I've be thinking that follow the playlist and programming that game will be a good idea! On these videos, Filipe shows the evolution of the code using design patterns and programming concepts.
So, first release is a 'copy' of the code that I learned watching these videos. This code is the basis for future releases with new features.
